## Data Analysis

fivethirtyeight package: Hate_crimes dataset

We utilized three variables to map the data: x axis represents the share of the state population voted for Trump in 2016 election; y axis represents the occurrences of hate crimes per 100,000 population; and the color represents the median household income (MHI) by state. We chose 3  colors, blue, purple and yellow, to make it natural to recognize that as the scale proceeds to a darker color, MHI increases and vice versa. We mapped this variables in this way since we were interested in seeing the correlation between the share of Trump voters and hate crimes and how wealthy these people are by mapping MHI to color. 

Every dot represents a state and its position explains its corresponding x and y value, as well as its relative position in the dataset. There is one state, Washington DC, that is an outlier with an exceptionally high MHI and number of hate crimes, so we didn't include it in the color mapping. We interpreted that this high rate of hate crimes in DC is due to the extreme political tension after the election in the capital.

Overall, MHI is negatively associated with voting for Trump and is roughly positively associated with occurences of hate crimes (especially when the occurrences of hate crimes are higher). Surprisingly, the correlation between the voting rate for Trump and the occurrences of hate crimes was negative and weak. Some of the states with low MHI also have the least diversity, a variable that was included in the dataset but wasn't added to our data graphic. However, there is a potential problem with the data: more hate crimes were reported with, as the researchers explained, “heightened news coverage of hate incidents” after the elections.
