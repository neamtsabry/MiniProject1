In which I plot Star Wars characters from the movie A New Hope 

```{r}
# Filter star wars data by our movie
# as well as mass (only those thar are less
# than 1000) and specfic species types

a_new_hope <- starwars %>%
  filter(mass < 1000, 
         grepl("A New Hope", films), 
         species %in% c("Rodian", "Droid", "Wookiee", "Human"))

# Plot data and color it by its species
myData <- ggplot(a_new_hope, aes(x = mass, y = height, col = species))

# Now graph it and add the following labels
myData +
  geom_point() +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = name)) +
  labs(title="Height and Mass of characters in New Hope(1977) \nSeparated by Species",
       captions = ("Source: Star Wars API")) +
  xlab("Mass (kilograms)") +
  ylab("Height (centimeters)")

```

It was hard to figure out how to filter the species to have only three appear on the graph. But now, I know several ways I can do it and I am very satisified with the results.
